# Geog 418 Fall 2024 - Assignment 1
All assignments for this course will be completed in the coding language R. There are two software that you will need to install: (1) [R version 4.4.1](https://www.r-project.org/), and (2) [R Studio version 2024.04.2](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). R is an open-source programming language fpr statistical analysis, while R Studio is the graphical user interface that provides you with editing and visualization capabilities. You can visit the video in the Read Me First Page on the course Brightspace site to learn how to download these software. 

R operates by running through lines of code that a user (e.g. you) creates. Like all languages, R is sensitive to spelling, upper/lower cases, and punctuation, so it is best to approach your coding in a slow and deliberate manner to ensure that you are not making any mistakes. In addition to code, you can enter comments in R that serve as plain text for explaining what the code is suppose to do.

There are really only three basic elements to coding. 
1. objects: this is the thing that you are doing something to with your code. It could be a number, a name, or a dataset (amongst other things)
2. variables: each object can have multiple variables that describe something about it. For example, if the object is a list of trees, the variable could be height
3. functions: a function is applied to do something to an object or a variable. For example, the function "mean" would return the average height of all the trees in your list. Functions can be short and simple or they can be very long and confusing. Sometimes we will ignore some of the elements of a function and just focus on the essentials.

Whatever your experience is with coding, please have the confidence that will learn some new skills and will walk away from this course with a new or polished tool in your analytical toolbelt. You can do it, we can help. Let's get started with Assignment 1.
